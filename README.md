# Reinforcement Learning

Two examples for presenting at the Advanced Machine Learning class at CEU Vienna,<br>
one example constructed by me on how one could train a RL model for the CartPole experiment/game, highlighting the possible mistakes one would make when naively designing a model for this problem, and one example taken from the Keras website (building on the DeepMind Atari paper) on using Deep Q-networks for the Atari Breakout game.
